# About Project
In this project, I utilized HTML5 for structure, CSS3 with Tailwind for responsive design, and JavaScript for interactivity. The repository was organized with directories for source files and assets, using GitHub for version control and collaboration. A README.md was included for clear documentation. This setup provided the foundation for creating a professional, user-centric landing page for Cache Bank.
